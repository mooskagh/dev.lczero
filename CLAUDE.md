- The project will be lczero_dev_portal, it will be a Django app hosted at dev.lczero.org, where various lc0-related dev reources be located (blunderbase, PR build artifacts, networks, runs, URL shortener configuration, competition watcher, etc). The authentication will be exclusively through LCZero discord.
- The claude code is started from the venv, so no need to prefix all commands with source. However, in critical potentially destructive actions like installing packages, make sure that we are under the correct venv.
